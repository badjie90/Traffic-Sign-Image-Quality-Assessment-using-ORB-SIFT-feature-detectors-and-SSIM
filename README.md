# Traffic-Sign-Image-Quality-Assessment-using-ORB-SIFT-feature-detectors-and-SSIM


In this repository, I used two methods for image comparison: ORB/SIFT feature detectors and SSIM measurement. ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) and SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) are both feature detection algorithms commonly used in computer vision for image matching and object recognition. These algorithms work by extracting distinctive features from images, which are then used to compare them. In other words, they help to identify key points or regions in an image that are invariant to changes in scale, rotation, and illumination.


On the other hand, SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measurement) is a method for measuring the similarity between two images based on their structural information. It compares the luminance, contrast, and structure of the images to determine how similar they are. This metric is often used to assess the quality of image compression algorithms or to compare the effectiveness of different image processing techniques.


Taken together, these two methods offer complementary approaches to image comparison. Feature detection algorithms like ORB and SIFT are good at identifying specific objects or regions in an image, while SSIM provides a more holistic measure of similarity based on the overall structure of the images. By combining these methods, researchers can develop more robust and accurate image comparison tools for a variety of applications in computer vision, such as image retrieval, object recognition, image compression, and adversarial image detection.
